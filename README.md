## Snap Creative Challenge

Project for the Computer Graphics class (2020). This was part of the SNAP creative challenge where we needed to reimagine the future of storytelling with augmented reality. We wanted to create a Mobile/tablet application where kids can draw monsters/animals, animate them and assign each monsters/animal to different location they visit. At the end of each assignment a pin is marked on a globe along with all the other pins that were placed the previous times. To visualize the animation of the monsters and the world globe, augmented reality (AR) will be used. Unfortunately due to outside circumstances we didn’t were able to complete our objective.
So we modified our project to turn drawings into real drawings. The users will have templates of drawings that they can color. After coloring it, they take a photo and their drawing will appear animated on their phone.
